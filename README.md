# DjangoApp — Personal Blog (First Django Project)

This repository contains my first Django project: a simple personal blog website.

## What this is

- A learning project: a Django-based blog for myself with posts, basic admin, and simple templates.
- Intentionally minimal so I can learn Django concepts, add features later, and deploy when ready.

## Features (planned)

- Create/read/update/delete blog posts via the Django admin
- Public listing of posts and individual post pages


## Next steps I might add

- Create `requirements.txt` to snapshot dependencies
- Add templates and basic views for blog listing and detail pages
- Add unit tests for core functionality
- Prepare deployment instructions

---

This is a learning project; improvements are expected over time.
